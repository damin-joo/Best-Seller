    "writerInfo": "Best known as the author of Asterix, Goscinny is\n\nalso the talent behind the scenario of Lucky Luke, the hugely popular\n\ncomic book of 'the cowboy who shoots faster than his shadow'. Goscinny\n\nwas born on 11 August 1926 in the 5th arrondissement of Paris, the son\n\nof Stanislas (Simkha) from Warsaw and of Anna Beresniak from\n\nKhodorkow, a small Ukrainian village. In 1928, his parents took him to\n\nArgentina, where his father, a chemical engineer, had been\n\nseconded. He spent a happy childhood in Buenos Aires, and studied at\n\nthe French Lyce just before the Second World War. He had a habit of\n\nmaking every one laugh in class, probably to compensate for a natural\n\nshyness. He started drawing very early on, inspired by the illustrated\n\nstories which he enjoyed reading. In 1945, he emigrated to the United\n\nStates. \"I went to the United States to work with Walt Disney\" he was\n\nto say later \"but Walt Disney didn't know that\". He found himself in\n\nNew York, jobless, alone and totally broke. The next 6 years, which he\n\nspent in New York, are often considered his formative years. As he\n\nsaid \"It was not so bad...it toughened me up, although I would have\n\nliked it better if others had been toughened up on my behalf\". It is\n\nduring these years that he met his first friends, some who were to\n\npublish \"Mad\" in 1945, and others with whom he was to collaborate for\n\na long time to come. Among these was Maurice de Bvre aka Morris, the\n\ncartoonist and first author of Lucky Luke. He also met Georges\n\nTroisfontaines, the boss of the World Press Agency in Belgium, who\n\npersuaded Goscinny to work for him. He returned to Europe in 1951 for\n\nthis purpose, but was fired in 1956 for trying to put in place a\n\ncharter to protect the status of cartoonists and scenarist. The years\n\nuntil the creation of the magazine \"Pilote\" were years of transition,\n\nwhen Goscinny's talent matured and he seized upon many\n\nopportunities. Besides his collaboration with Morris on the Lucky Luke\n\nseries from 1955 onwards, Goscinny worked on the scenario of \"Le petit\n\nNicolas\" (Little Nicholas) in cartoon form with its creator, Sempe. In\n\n1959 the magazine \"Pilote\" was launched. Goscinny found his place in the\n\neditorial team among some of his faithful friends from World\n\nPress. The aim of \"Pilote\" was to change radically the way that the\n\ngraphic novel (\"the BD\") would be perceived in France, and competed\n\nwith \"Tintin\" and \"Spirou\" magazines on their own territories. How best to\n\ngo about that task than by inventing an astute little Gaul, give him a\n\nlarge size sidekick and place their adventures within a little village\n\nof irreducible Gauls whose names all end in -ix? Asterix is born. The\n\nbande dessinee enters adulthood. He married Gilberte Pollaro-Millo in\n\n1967. In 1968 his daughter Anne is born. Many young authors owe their\n\nfame to Goscinny, who opened for them the pages of \"Pilote\". While\n\nworking on scenarios for the television and the cinema and on many\n\ndifferent texts, Goscinny headed Pilote in one capacity or another\n\nuntil his death on 5 November 1977.\n\nPhoto by Peters, Hans / Anefo [CC BY-SA 3.0 nl (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/nl/deed.en)], via Wikimedia Commons.",

His views contributed to the rise of the philosophy known as absurdism. He wrote in his essay The Rebel that his whole life was devoted to opposing the philosophy of nihilism while still delving deeply into individual freedom. He won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1957.\n\nCamus did not consider himself to be an existentialist despite usually being classified as one, even in his lifetime. In a 1945 interview, Camus rejected any ideological associations: \"\"No, I am not an existentialist. Sartre and I are always surprised to see our names linked...\"\".\n\nCamus was born in Algeria to a Pied-Noir family, and studied at the University of Algiers from which he graduated in 1936. In 1949, Camus founded the Group for International Liaisons to \"\"denounce two ideologies found in both the USSR and the USA\"\".\n\nBio from Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.
